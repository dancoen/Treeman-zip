Treeman by Dan Coen

The game uses left, right, up and space on the keyboard for controls. 
You'll need to use the mouse for the menu screen.

This game was created as part of my learning experience beginning
to write code for games in Fall 2015. It's not the most polished 
but If you're looking for a few minutes of fun it should do the trick. 
The game has a UI for touch controls because it can also be compiled for
ios easily using gamemaker. The code for touch controls has been commented
out in the source files because I assumed most people will be playing this 
on Windows or Mac.

I hope you enjoy all of the cringy hand-drawn assets. I will be trying to 
create a game using the unity engine now, but fear not as a Treeman reboot
in the future looks possible based on the demand from its die-hard fans.

Thanks for playing,

-DC
